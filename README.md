## Project Description

Token Tally serves as a decentralized hackathon judging platform that promotes transparency and fairness by honoring predefined agreements via smart contracts and programmable wallets.

Judges are given a set amount of tokens to allocate across multiple projects as they see fit. After the judging round concludes, the tokens and any prize earnings are automatically distributed to team members using a smart contract and Circles programmable wallet, based on pre-determined allocation percentages. Powered by the Flow blockchain, Token Tally ensures transparent, fair, and automated reward distribution.
